  "description": "This was taken in the kitchen of the Curtis Home, a local historical house and museum.  The house dates to the 1870, and the items on the shelf are intended to represent kitchen and cooking items from that period.  I was attracted to the scene by the soft lighting, the linear, horizontal shelf, the negative space underneath, and the small, single metal cup hanging below, offsetting the busy, closely packed items on top.",
